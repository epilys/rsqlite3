# sqlite3 Rewritten in RiiR Rust ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

Finally, one of the best written software paired with one of the best writable programming languageâ€½ Fearless and memory safe, since the uncountable amount of `unsafe {}` blocks makes you not care anymore.

## Build and run

```shell
$ cargo +nightly build --release
# ... bunch of stuff I choose not to understand/read
warning: `rsqlite3` (bin "rsqlite3") generated 37 warnings (24 duplicates)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 39.84s
$ ./target/release/rsqlite3

SQLite version 3.37.0 2021-10-17 10:31:09
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

## Wait, what?

This is just the sqlite3 code passed throught the
[`c2rust`](https://c2rust.com/) transpiler, along with some cleanup from me.
I've found no way to hook it to sqlite3's testing harnesses yet so I doubt it's
completely functional; but opening the shell seems to work.

I am suspicious that a lot of code under ifdefs or not is lost through the transpilation, because the binary size difference is substantial:

```shell
$ du -sh $(which sqlite3)
9.5M    /home/epilys/.local/bin/sqlite3
$ du -sh target/release/rsqlite3
5.1M    target/release/rsqlite3
```
